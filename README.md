# Cafeflow ☕
**Digital Order-to-Cup Management System**

Cafeflow is a full-stack real-time coffee shop ordering system built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)** and **Supabase**.
It connects customers and kitchen staff through a seamless, token-based workflow without requiring user accounts.

The system eliminates manual token handling, reduces queue friction, and provides a live operational dashboard.
